# Homework Assignment 4

1. Practice typing and memorizing the exercises from this week, repeating daily.

 * [index-3.html](https://github.com/biscuitvile/teaching-material/blob/master/project-2/index-3.html)

2. Read through beginner JavaScript tutorials on
   [HTMLDog](https://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/). Much of this material
   should seem familiar to you. Sometimes learning the same material from
   difference places can help your knowledge.

3. Think about what you've learned so far in project 2. Apply what we've done
   to make a similar application. This application should be a task list. Make
   a list that has an input and a button to add more tasks to the list. Each
   task should also have a check box to mark whether or not the task is
   completed or not. In the future we will make this list dynamic, but for now
   just focus on adding tasks to the list and rendering the list. The tasks
   should remain after you reload the page (think localStorage). This is
   similar to our movie list!
