# Linux computing with Raspberry Pi

The majority of the servers in the world are running on Unix or Linux. In order
to learn about server programming we will need to get a Unix or Linux computer.
The easiest way to do this is with an inexpensive microcomputer called
Raspberry Pi. Read about and order a Raspberry Pi. *If you have difficulty
affording the Raspberry Pi I can get one for you, just let me know.*

Read more about Raspberry Pi at
[raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org). The easiest way to get started
with Raspberry Pi is by purchasing a
[kit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-kit.html).
